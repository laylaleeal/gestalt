## Accessibility

Ensure AvatarGroup have labels describing both the data presented and the call to action in case of icon buttons.

People use Androidâ€™s accessibility features, such as TalkBack and dynamic text sizing to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:
